# Python Script interacting with SQL Database

In this project, I used the SQL Lab as my base repo. I copied the lab's repository and then proceeded with the Gorcery Database. I fixed the query so we can see the top 5 rows. In addition I added a function that allows us to insert a row into the database. I added a test case to make sure we can connect to the database. I followed CRUD Operations by doing the following: 

- Database Creation
- Query which SELECTS first 5 rows.
- Insert a row
- Save the database and update the table using a temp csv and the base csv.

This project works on a matrix build of 3.7,3.8,3.9.
